= SharedLib for Production Line
:imagesdir: doc/assets/images

This project is a Jenkins Shared Library ( see https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/ ) which provides several methods to do a pre-configuration of the 'Production Line'.

:toc:

== Introduction
The global lib structure is package based and the hierarchy is as follows:

[source]
----
com
 |
 \- capgemini
     |
     \- productionline
         |
         |- configuration (containing all packages for configuring the components of the ProductionLine) 
         |
         |- build (common functions used during build process)
         |
         \- deployment (common functions used during the deployment process)
----

For further information (like usage examples) please have a look in the ```doc/configuration``` folder of this repository. To find detailed information about the available methods please take a look at the *groovydoc* documentation in each class ( ```src/com/capgemini/productionline/configuration``` ).
